I live here with my\n       wife, our dog Chilito and my cat Calvin (she denies ownership of \"that cat\").  I grew up in a house in the woods in Sag Harbor, NY (before it was rich) and attended\n       Pierson High School there.  When I finished that I was excited to move away for college and got accepted to McGill University where I studied Political Science with\n       a double major in History.  After briefly returning to Sag, I got a job at a great company in the DC area and moved there to do it; however, by then I had my sights\n       set on moving to the UK (my dad is from there) so I just planned to save up in DC until I could afford to make the big move which I did in 2010.  I worked a contract\n       job as a project analyst at the Royal Bank of Scotland for about a year and then moved on to be an IT Project Officer at the City of Edinburgh Council.  I loved both\n       roles and nearly stayed at the Council for good, but in 2013 I got an offer from my old company in DC that I really couldn't say no to and back I went to DC to a company\n       I'm still with today (albeit, working for them remotely here in St. Augustine).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I've wanted to further my education for years now, just didn't know what to further it with.  After a lot of soul-searching one day it just hit me - get back into tech.\n      I say back because when I was a super-nerd teen, an aunt gave me an old Gateway PC - a 386 processor with I think 4MB of RAM (I saved all summer to upgrade it to 8) and\n      maybe a 200MB hard dive, if that, and I totally lost myself in it.  First by making liberal use of AOL free trial disks, then joining chat-rooms, to eventually chatting\n      about how to build computers (which I did) and finally, how to build software.  The height of this was a text based game (I SO wish I could recover) I wrote on\n      C++ based on my middle school pals and distributed to them all on 3.5\" floppies.  Good times.  Then, I went to college, majored in something completely unrelated and forgot\n      all about it - something I have been regretting for years.  The choice was clear, I wanted to learn to code.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     I spent the last year or so in Flatiron School's Self-Paced Online Coding Bootcamp and graduated in December, 2020 as a full-fledged junior\n     (very junior) software developer.So welcome to my portfolio site which contains the fruits of my studies in the \"My Projects\" section below.\n     I do my coding on Linux and I can work with Ruby/Rails, Rack (Sinatra), JavaScript, React/Redux and some basic C++, but I'm learning more every day, and that is my favorite thing about coding.\n    </p>\n    </div>\n
