    description: "Since I was a kid, coding has been my passion.  I am looking for any and all opportunities to put my coding skills to good use, ideally leveraging my extensive project management and/or association management experience. I'm fascinated with the concept of creating amazing programs from nothing but a text editor and I'm hoping to make it more than just a hobby someday soon.  Have a project you're like to talk about?
